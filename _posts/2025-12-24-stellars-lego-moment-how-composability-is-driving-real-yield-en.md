## ☕ TL;DR
*   **Hockey Stick Growth**: Beans wallet users nearly tripled their deposits after integrating DeFi yield. 📈
*   **The Secret Sauce**: Composability on Stellar allowed seamless connection with DeFindex and Blend. 🧩
*   **Win-Win-Win**: Users earn, Apps get revenue, Protocols get liquidity. It's a perfect loop. 🔄

## The Scoop: Breaking Down Barriers 🔨
DeFi has a usability problem. We all know it. Managing keys, bridging assets, and navigating complex UIs is a nightmare for the average Joe.

But the **Beans** wallet on Stellar just showed us a glimpse of the future. By integrating with **DeFindex** (a yield aggregator), they enabled users to access yields from **Blend** (a lending protocol) without ever leaving the app.

The result? **70% of users** are now actively using the earn feature, and average deposit sizes **tripled**.


## Why It Matters: The Power of Integration 🔗
This isn't just about one wallet features. It's a masterclass in **Composability**.

Think of it like LEGO bricks.
*   **Beans**: The front-end interface (The cool spaceship design).
*   **DeFindex**: The logic engine (The connectors).
*   **Blend**: The financial utility (The base plate).


Because these protocols are composable, Beans didn't have to build a lending platform from scratch. They just plugged into one. And importantly, it remains **non-custodial**. Users keep control, but the friction is gone.

## The Big Picture: A Sustainable Business Model 💼
Let's talk money. Why would developers build this?
**Revenue Sharing.**

DeFindex transforms user deposits into yield, and a portion of that yield is shared as a fee between the aggregator (DeFindex) and the integrator (Beans). This creates a recurring revenue stream for wallet developers without charging users upfront fees.


With Stellar's **Soroban** smart contract platform ramping up, we're going to see a lot more of these "Money Legos" clicking together. Meru, Airtm, and Lobstr are already on board. The silo effect is dying; the connected ecosystem is rising.
